# Redirector

Nginx configuration and supporting tools and tests for the redirector, an Ngnix server used to redirect old websites being moved to GOV.UK.

## Sites

Each site is configured using a yaml file in the `data/sites` directory:

* `site` — friendly name for the site
* `host` — primary hostname for site
* `redirection_date` — planned go live date
* `tna_timestamp` — timestamp of the last good National Archives capture
* `title` — site title for 410 page
* `furl` — friendly URL displayed on error pages
* `homepage` — URL for new site, used to redirect '/'
* `aliases` — list of alias domains

## Mappings

A CSV file in `data/mappings` for each site containing:

* `Old Url` — the Url to be redirected in canonical form
* `New Url` — the destination Url for a 301
* `Status` — 301 for a redirect, 410 for a page which is being deprecated
* `Suggested Link` — an optional suggested link for the 410 page
* `Archive Link` — an alternative link to The National Archives for the 410 page

During development, mappings are usually generated from spreadsheets, or using scripts.
Once live they are maintained in this repository.

`New Url` values may only contain a hostname cited in `data/whitelist.txt`.

## Server config

An nginx server block for each site in `redirector/configs`.

## Build

The build is through [GNU Make](http://www.gnu.org/software/make/), to build the site:

    $ ./jenkins.sh

## Dist

Nginx configuration is generated in `dist`.


## Assets

Directgov and Businesslink assets are stored in GitHub and deployed via s3,  see [assets-directgov](https://github.com/alphagov/assets-directgov) and [assets-businesslink](https://github.com/alphagov/assets-businesslink).

## Test

A list of the most important urls to be tested on each website in `data/tests/subsets/`.

You will need to install some Perl packages like this:
    sudo cpan Text::CSV
    sudo cpan YAML
    sudo cpan Crypt::SSLeay
    sudo cpan Mozilla::CA

### Test in a virtual

    export DEPLOY_TO=dev
    ./tools/smoke_tests.sh

### Test against preview

    export DEPLOY_TO=preview
    ./tools/smoke_tests.sh

### Test against production

    export DEPLOY_TO=production
    ./tools/smoke_tests.sh

## Akamai

The redirector is deployed behind Akamai. The domain should be added as a property to the Akamai redirector configuration before changing the DNS of websites being redirected.
